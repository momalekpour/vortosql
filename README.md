# NL2SQL Data Agent

## Setup Environment

**1. Clone the Repository**

Clone the project repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/momalekpour/nl2sql-data-agent.git
cd nl2sql-data-agent
```

 **2. Installation**

You will first need to install `uv` to manage dependencies. Follow the instructions at the official [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Once `uv` is installed, run the following command to install all dependencies, including optional ones for development:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

This command will also automatically generate and manage a virtual environment (`./venv`) in the `nl2sql-data-agent` directory. `uv` will also handle fetching the appropriate Python version as needed.

If you're contributing or developing code, install the `pre-commit` hooks for automatic linting (`ruff`) and formatting (`black`). Run the following command:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```
